# ü§ù Hi there, I'm Jorge Daniel Gomez

I'm a system's engineer from Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas.

üß† I'm specialized on Data Science. I like to solve problems related with data üìà and automation ü§ñ.

üìö I consider myself as an autodidact person of fast learning, I like to learn about technology, math, science and business. Furthermore, I consider myself an eternal student.

üåè I Think that I'm very optimistic, determined and analytical. I love the challenges üòé

üìñ Data is the main resource of our era, if it is not used it is a lost opportunity for change and improvement.
